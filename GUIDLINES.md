## What to Create

To create a design for a UI Element you have to create a html file, a css file and add the metadata in the ui-elements.json file.

## Where to Create

- The HTML and CSS files should be saved in the directory corresponding to the ui element.  
- For example,   
If you are creating a button, save the HTML and CSS files in the __ui-elements/buttons/__ directory.  
- You can create and submit multiple designs at a time. If you are creating multiple designs at a time you should create HTML and CSS files for each design.  

## Naming Rules

- Always give same name to both HTML and CSS files.  
- Name each file in the following format :  

    __github_username-design_name.html__  
    __github_username-design_name.css__

- If you are creating multiple designs, each design name should be different.  
- Always add your github username with the file name to avoid duplicate names.
- Avoid using whitespaces while naming use _ or - instead.


## Adding Metadata

- Add the information about the design in the ui-elements.json file in the following format :   

```json
{
    "element": [
        {
            "username": "Your github username",
            "name": "Design Name",
            "htmlFile": "github_username-design_name.html",
            "cssFile": "github_username-design_name.css"
        }
    ]
}
```
